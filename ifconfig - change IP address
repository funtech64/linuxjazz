Change IP on Server

8-6-18 - container didn't have this setup for it's sytem but the Proxmox server itself seems to. 

Will finally be able to fix iP to .7 but Cisco switch takes priority...

apt install net-tools

nano /etc/network/interfaces

Tried changin interfaces.d and it was not part of the container software.

Ran changes to # nano /etc/network/interfaces but this didn't work.


# cat /etc/network/interfaces.d/eth0
iface eth0 inet static
      address 10.1.1.125
      netmask 255.0.0.0
      gateway 10.1.1.1

Perhaps I'm lazy as it rolled back to DHCP and looked to the router and it took the new IP that way instead of my changes working.
