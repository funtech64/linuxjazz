Can I use a C/C++ compiler

Ubuntu provides the standard Gnu Compiler Collection in the repositories.

You can install the Gnu C Compiler gcc as well as the Gnu C++ compiler g++ with the following command:

sudo apt-get install gcc g++

You'll probably also want to install libc6-dev (which includes the C standard library) and libstdc++6-4.5-dev (which includes the standard C++ libraries).
