How to connect USB Serial Console Cable to Linux
by Nish Vamadevan on 13/10/2013 @nish

The following guide will walk you through on setting up USB Serial Console Cable on a Linux via command line.

First of all, make sure you have a program called Minicom installed.

I will be using Ubuntu flavored Operating System for demonstration purposes.

apt-get install minicom

Then you need to connect the USB Serial adapter and find out which serial port is it connected to.

dmesg | grep USB

You will see something similar to this output.

[    6.804403] usb 1-1.3: pl2303 converter now attached to ttyUSB0

Make sure you chmod 777 /dev/ttyUSB0 so minicom will allow you to save the config.

Open up minicom by running the command minicom -s and select Serial port setup

Reflect the output you saw from dmesg and set it to the Serial Device by pressing AE > C

A – Serial Device : /dev/ttyUSB0
E – Bps/Par/Bits : 9600 8N1

Please see the following screenshot for more info.

minicom-config

Then Save setup as dfl then exit.
