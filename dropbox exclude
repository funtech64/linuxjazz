$ dropbox exclude add /Home/jollx/Dropbox/Park-Jolly

It would seem that the /Home/jollx is missed on commands and the system does not have a failure notice on some distros.

$ dropbox exclude list
Excluded: 
Dropbox/camera
Dropbox/park-jolly

This is the only way of seeing if the list has worked.
The top line is the perfect line of code for how to run this.
