Google Chrome isn't in the repositories - however, Chromium is.
Google Chrome is only available for 64-bit Linux. I've included directions for 64 below.

How to install Chrome browser properly via command line
Google Chrome isn't in the repositories - however, Chromium is.
Google Chrome is only available for 64-bit Linux. I've included directions for 64 below.
To install Google Chrome, run the following:
sudo apt-get install libxss1 libappindicator1 libindicator7
wget https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i google-chrome*.deb

If error messages pop up after running the command sudo dpkg -i google-chrome*.deb then run the command
sudo apt-get install -f
and then re-run the previous command. The error messages mentioned should include something similar to
google-chrome-stable depends on [lib-example]; however; Package [lib-example] is not installed.

This installs a needed library for Google Chrome, then downloads the latest version of Chrome to a temporary directory and installs it. Run google-chrome to start the browser.
During the installation a PPA is added to your system so that Google Chrome receives the latest updates whenever you check for system updates.
