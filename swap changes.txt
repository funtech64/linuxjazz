1. For smooth running of Spotify we recommend to increase swap space. Open configuration file in Terminal (command line) using the following command:
$ sudo nano /etc/dphys-swapfile
Raspbian has 100MB of swap by default. You should change it to 2000MB in the configuration file. So you will have to find this line:
CONF_SWAPSIZE=100
And then change it into:
CONF_SWAPSIZE=2048
Press F3 key to save changes and F2 to close the file. Then restart dphys-swapfile to apply changes:
$ sudo /etc/init.d/dphys-swapfile stop
$ sudo /etc/init.d/dphys-swapfile start
