CONCLUSION - Xiphos is dead!!!! Simply install BibleTime
Installing wine than E-Sword is a breeze.





Welcome to Xiphos.

There are no Bibles installed. In order to initialize, Xiphos needs at least one Bible module. To facilitate this, the Module Manager has been opened so that you may install one or more Bibles, either from a local module set (cdrom, flash drive) or over the network from CrossWire Bible Society. Please refer to these step-by-step instructions, and to the general module manager overview that has also been opened.

For local install:
- In Module Sources: Add/Remove, add a new local folder name where modules can be found.
  (This is where folders exist named mods.d and modules.)
- In Module Sources: Choose, click the "Local" button, and select your folder from the pulldown.

For network install from CrossWire:
- In Module Sources: Choose, click the "Remote" button and select CrossWire from the pulldown.
- Click the "Refresh" button at the bottom.

In either case:
- In Modules: Install/Update, select Bibles and other modules of your preference.
- Click "Install".
- Close the Module Manager when you are done.

Warning: If you live in a persecuted country, use with care.

Both this step-by-step instruction dialog and the general introduction dialog may be closed at any time.

Overview of the Module Manager.

This is Xiphos' mechanism to get new and updated content.
If you have never been here before, please take a moment to look it over.

Modules come from different repositories.  Module Sources: Add/Remove will show you what repositories are currently known.

Module Sources: Choose is for deciding from where modules should come, that is, from which repository Xiphos should obtain them, as well as where they should be placed on your system. Set Install Source and Install Destination, then click Refresh.

Modules: Install/Update is for selecting and obtaining modules after choosing source and destination.

Modules: Maintenance is for archive and index creation.

See section 5 of our manual for Module Manager detail, or ask for help via Live Chat, or (if no one is responsive in chat) send mail to our users' mailing list.
