HAVEN'T CHECKED ANY OF THE PYTHON!!!

ipython[notebook] was crazy and may not have installed. I later checked 
pip install --user ipython
and it seems to be ok.

Pandas required cython

Bottleneck gave wierdo error "traceback" on $ python -c "import bottleneck;print bottleneck.__version__"

Stuck at CMPy

I am not sure how to load github to get CMPy to load!!!!
Really it's time to learn the freakin github as my computer is getting slowly held back by this..
