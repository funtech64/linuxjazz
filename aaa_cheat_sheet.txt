Useful Linux Commands (Red Hat)

Revised 3/1/2000

Getting information
———

man commandname
display the manual page for a particular command named commandname
man -S sectionnumber commandname
display the manual page under a specific section numbered sectionnumber for the command named commandname. Sometimes the same command will exist in more than one section. man alone will display the lowest-numbered section only. To see other sections, you’ll need to use the -s flag. The different sections are:
1 – user commands
2 – system calls
3 – libc calls
4 – devices
5 – file formats and protocols
6 – games
7 – conventions, macro packages, etc.
8 – system administration
man -l commandname
list all the man pages available for commandname
man -l intro
interesting reading– when you have the time
man -K keyword
searches all man pages for keywords

info
the other major way to find information about commands. Somewhat obscure to navigate, but quite useful. Basically, navigate using tab key to select a node, return key to enter a node, ‘l’ key to go back, ‘q’ to quit. Useful information available through info include:
libg++
iostream
gdb
make
tar
gzip
which commandname
find the path to a commandname
whatis commandname
tells you what a command is and does. works sometimes.

File Manipulation
———

Some file notations

. (current directory)
./myfile.txt (a file in current directory)
./mydirectory/myfile.txt (a file in a subdirectory of current directory)
mydirectory/myfile.txt (same as above, a file in a subdirectory of current directory)
.. (parent directory of current directory)
../otherdirectory (a sibling subdirectory of current directory [go back one level and down another directory])
/ (the ultimate root directory)
~ (my home directory)
~/mydirectory (a subdirectory of my home directory)
~otheruser (another user’s home directory)
filename*.txt (“*” is the wildcard character)

cp fromfilename tofilename
copy from fromfilename tofilename

mv fromfilename tofilename
Move from fromfilename to tofilename.

——————
rm
remove a file (DANGER: this is permanent!)
rm -i
asks you before removing a file
rm -R
recursively remove a directory and every file in it (DANGER)
> filename
redirect output to a file named filename. Overwrites that file. Example: ls > directory.txt
>> filename
redirect output to a file named filename. Appends to the end of that file.
< redirect in
redirect input to a program. Example: myprogram < myfile.txt
| mycommand
pipe output so it goes through a certain command. Example: ls -l | less
| grep myword
pipe output through grep. grep searches for “myword” and displays only those lines containing that word. Example (to search for all files containing “.cc”: ls -l | grep .cc
find mydirectory -name “nametolookfor”
searches mydirectory and all its subdirectories for a file named “nametolookfor”
find . -name “proj3*”
searches the current directory and all its subdirectories for a file begining with “proj3″.

Moving Around

cd –
changes to the last directory you were in.

Executing commands (some are tcsh-specific)

This suspends a currently running command. You can then use “bg” or “fg” on it.
bg
Sends your suspended command to run in the background.
fg

!foo
repeats the last command you ran beginning with the word “foo”

jobs

nice +nicelevel commandname
runs a command with a lower priority. Priorities range from 0 to +19, +19 being the lowest priority available. If you are going to run a cpu-intensive command, it is nice to nice it.
renice +nicelevel jobnumber
resets a particular command to a different priority level

ps
shows your current processes attached to this terminal. Use “ps -aux” to see everything.

top
