---------------
Install SSH Server package using apt command.
--------------


sudo apt update

sudo apt install -y openssh-server

The SSH service will start automatically upon the completion of package installation. You can verify the SSH server package installation by running the following command.

systemctl status ssh

.....(not apt... typo by writer)

sudo systemctl enable ssh

.....(missed)

------------------
Enable SSH Root Access on Ubuntu / Linux Mint / Debian
--------------------

By default, root login over SSH is not allowed on Ubuntu / Linux Mint / Debian. But, you can enable root login by editing the SSH configuration file.

Edit the sshd_config file.

sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config

Set the PermitRootLogin to Yes

PermitRootLogin Yes

Restart the SSH service.

sudo systemctl restart ssh

Now you should be able to login directly as the root via ssh.
