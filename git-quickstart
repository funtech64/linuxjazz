basic git setup

mkdir xxx
cd xxx
git init (initilize)
create file
git add - makes Git care about file
git commit - sets it in a state in Git that tracks what happens to it.

(tac) m "allows us to add notes to the commit"

alter a file...

*** run git status and it offers options

git add <file> re-commit

git checkout <file> - discards the changes

teacher: git add . - adds all the files back into the commit

!!! no -m or note does not allow the commit to complete


git log - shows all the crap that was done and the author that did it..


git rm removes the file from the git repository. NO event on the file.
