Recovery from cinnamon crashes and freezes in Linux Mint

Greg Freeman | Tips & Tricks | 11

Here is a useful command that I use to recover from a freeze or crash in the cinnamon desktop.

Update: since this post was made a better way of recovering cinnamon is with the following commands:

pkill -HUP -f "cinnamon --replace"
killall -HUP cinnamon
export DISPLAY=:0.0; cinnamon

If you cinnamon crashes or freezes on you, go to tty1 (ctrl-alt-f1), login and then run this command:

export DISPLAY=:0.0 && cinnamon --replace

If your DISPLAY is not :0.0 type w in shell to find out.

Once this is done press ctrl-alt-f7 to return to the desktop.
