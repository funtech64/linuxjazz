Now you’ll need to create a directory to mount the hard drive on. Since we’re actually booting off the live cd, the directory doesn’t really get created anywhere.

sudo mkdir /media/sda1

The next command will mount the hard drive in the /media/sda1 folder.

sudo mount /dev/sda1 /media/sda1

Now it’s time for the command that actually does the magic: chroot. This command is used to open up a shell with a different root directory than the current shell is using, and we’ll pass in the folder where we mounted the hard drive.

sudo chroot /media/sda1

Now you should be able to use the passwd command to change your user account’s password, and it will be applied to the hard drive since we are using chroot.

Password Reset

Now you should be able to use the passwd command to change your user account’s password, and it will be applied to the hard drive since we are using chroot.

passwd (username)

Note that you’ll have to type your username after the passwd command in order to change the right password.
