Ubuntu:

sudo snap install docker

All OS

wget -qO- https://get.docker.com | sh
--->somehow this didn't work and the teacher is lame. I went to docker's support site and got the direct instructions here:

https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository
https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/

----
throwing logic out of window and long long step install, go to docker.



2) sudo usermod -aG docker jollx
