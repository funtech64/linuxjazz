god I feel stupid. I've been digging around trying to figure out how to rename a file for the past 15 minutes. I tried hunting for "rename" in the man pages but all I get is is a man page for some C library that discusses file renaming. Maybe that's what I'm looking for, but I'm not sure.

Now really though, I feel stupid. Can somebody tell me how to rename a file or directory?

If it's like Linux, just "mv" the file to its new name\location.
