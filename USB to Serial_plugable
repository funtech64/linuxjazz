            Setup.   Root  edits  the  system-wide  defaults   in   /etc/mini‚Äê
            com/minirc.dfl  with  this  option.  When it is used, minicom does
            not initialize, but puts you directly into the configuration menu.
            This  is  very  handy  if minicom refuses to start up because your
            system has changed, or for the first time  you  run  minicom.  For
            most systems, reasonable defaults are already compiled in.
